REM RandomEllipses

REM draw 10 ellipses, choosing a random centre
FOR count% = 1 TO 10
  REM with x and y both between -250 and 1249
  SETXY(RND(1500) - 250, RND(1500) - 250)
  REM and ellipse radii between 500 and 999
  ELLIPSE(RND(500) + 500, RND(500) + 500)
NEXT
REM initialise colour variable
nextColour% = 0
REM try to fill all ellipses with colours
FOR count% = 1 TO 10000
  REM pick a random point
  x% = RND(1000)
  y% = RND(1000)
  REM if pixel is in a white region
  IF PIXCOL(x%, y%) = WHITE THEN
    REM choose next colour in the sequence
    nextColour% = (nextColour% MOD 20) + 1
    REM recolour region in that colour
    RECOLOUR(x%, y%, RGB(nextColour%))
