END

REM draws a polygon with given sides & colour
DEF PROCpoly(sides%, colr%)
  LOCAL count%
  REM point Turtle horizontally to right
  DIRECTION(90)
  REM trace shape with the Turtle
  FOR count% = 1 TO sides%
    REM edge is shorter as sides increases
    FORWARD(600 DIV sides%)
    REM turn left by correct external angle
    LEFT(360 DIV sides%)
  NEXT
