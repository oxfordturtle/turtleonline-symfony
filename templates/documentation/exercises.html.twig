  <h1>Self-Teach Exercises</h1>
  <p>The <em>Turtle System</em> supports programming in several specially designed languages. These are cut-down versions of their respective parent languages, but are still highly expressive, with support for constants and variables, procedures and functions, loops and conditionals, keyboard and mouse input detection, and of course Turtle Graphics commands for drawing and animation. The core documentation for these languages is available within the Turtle System itself, under the “QuickHelp 1” and “QuickHelp 2” tabs, and in the <a href="{{ path('documentation_languages') }}">Turtle Languages</a> documentation on this site. In addition, the links below provide some self-teach exercises, which are designed to help complete beginners get started with the basics of text-based programming.</p>
