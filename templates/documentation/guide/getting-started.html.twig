    <h3>1.1. Getting Started on Windows</h3>
    <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> is available as a desktop application for Windows, downloadable from <a href="https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/download">https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/download</a>. No installation is required; simply save the file anywhere on your hard disk, and then double-click to run it. When you first attempt to run the file, however, Windows will probably warn you that it is of unknown origin, and therefore potentially unsafe. This is because our project does not have the funds available to pay for a code-signing certificate. To run the file, you will need to click ‘More Information’, and then ‘Run Anyway’.</p>
    <p>When you first run the file, you will also see a dialog prompt inviting you to create a personal Turtle directory. Once created, this directory will be used by default as the base directory for file handling, and you will no longer see this prompt when you start the system in the future. You can bring it up manually, however, and modify your directory settings, through the Options menu. Please see the relevant entry under <a href="{{ path('documentation_guide', {tab: 'the-options-menu'}) }}">The Options Menu</a> section below for more details.</p>

    <h3>1.2. Getting Started Online</h3>
    <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> is also available as a progressive web application, which can be run directly in your browser (<a href="https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/run">https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/run</a>), and installed for offline use (look for the ‘+’ icon in your address bar or the ‘Add to Home Screen’ prompt on your phone’s browser). Note that offline installation is not available through all browsers; we recommend using either Google Chrome or the latest version of Microsoft Edge.</p>
    <p>Some features of the web application&mdash;notably saving your system preferences, and reading and writing files to your personal space on our web server&mdash;are only available if you are online and signed in to an account on this site. Creating an account is completely free and comes with no strings attached. The only thing we would like to do is email you occasionally with information regarding any new developments, but you can opt out of receiving any emails if you wish.</p>
    <p>The Windows desktop application and the progressive web application are maintained independently, and although we do our best to keep them in sync, development in one system sometimes moves ahead of the other. There are also some intentional differences (and some unavoidable ones) that will always remain, such as those regarding file handling, machine settings, customisation, and some nuances in how canvas graphics are realised. This guide describes both systems simultaneously, pointing out any differences along the way.</p>
