  <h2>4. The Language Menu</h2>
  <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> supports programming in three languages, <i>Turtle BASIC</i>, <i>Turtle Pascal</i>, and <i>Turtle Python</i>, with additional languages being planned for the future. (Note however that <i>Turtle Python</i> is currently being redeveloped, and has been disabled in the latest version of the Windows application. In the meantime, you can continue to use it in the legacy version 11 or in the online system.)</p>
  <p>By default, the <i>Turtle System</i> opens in <i>Turtle Pascal</i>, but you can change between languages at any time using the “LANGUAGE” menu. Changing the language will change the language-specific help under the “QuickHelp 1” tab, but also&mdash;more importantly&mdash;will change the compiler to expect programs in the new language. Note that this can lead to some surprising error messages. If you try to compile a correct <i>Turtle Pascal</i> program in <i>Turtle Python</i>, for example, the compiler will very quickly encounter an error. No attempt is made to automatically guess which language your program has been written in, and this is by design: we do not wish to hide from users the fact that different languages have to be handled by different compilers.</p>
