  <h1>The Turtle System</h1>
  <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> is a free educational program developed at the University of Oxford, designed to support the new Computer Science component of the National Curriculum, and to bridge the &ldquo;Post-<i>Scratch</i> Gap&rdquo; between visual programming systems like <i>Scratch</i> and text-based programming. It supports several languages, all of which are compiled to portable code for a virtual <i>Turtle Machine</i>. The workings of the compilers and of the <i>Turtle Machine</i> are all open to inspection, providing many additional learning opportunities for advanced students.</p>

  <h2>Download for Windows</h2>
  <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> is available as a traditional desktop app for Windows, downloable from the links below. No installation is required; simply double-click the file to run it. The first time you run the program, Windows may warn you that it is of unknown origin, and therefore potentially unsafe. To run it, click ‘More Information’ and then ‘Run Anyway’.</p>

  <h2>Run Online and on other Platforms</h2>
  <p>The <i>Turtle System</i> is also available as a progressive web app, which can be run directly in your browser (click on <a href="{{ path("online") }}">Run in Browser</a> above), and installed for offline use (look for the ‘+’ icon in your address bar or the ‘Add to Home Screen’ prompt on your phone’s browser). This version has fewer features than the traditional desktop app (at least for now). In particular, it does not yet support arrays or file handling. When file handling is implemented, it will enable reading and writing files to your personal space on our server, which is created for you when you register for an account on this site.</p>
  <h2>Further Information</h2>
  <p>Please see the <a href="{{ path('documentation') }}">Documentation</a> section for detailed information about the <i>Turtle System</i> and how to use it. For a discussion of the principles behind the System, see the <a href="{{ path('about') }}">About</a> page, or Peter Millican’s articles in <a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/">Computing at School</a>’s <a href="http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/3127">SwitchedOn</a> magazine.</p>
  <p>As part of a joint project between Oxford University and Queen Mary, University of London, and with funding from the Department for Education, a book entitled ‘Computer Science Across the Curriculum’ has been written, to illustrate the value of Computer Science in various different aspects of the national curriculum. For details, and links to the example programs, see the <a href="{{ path('documentation_csac') }}">Computer Science Across the Curriculum</a> page. These examples are also available directly from the ‘File’ tab of the <a href="{{ path('online') }}">Online Turtle System</a>.</p>
